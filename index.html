            <h1>Heartstone Review</h1>
            <p>Gameplay: The gameplay is so addictive and always had me talking myself into just one more game each time I finished playing one. </p>
            <p>Presentation: Blizzard being Blizzard, the presentation of Hearthstone is great.  The graphics are expertly and beautifully crafted.  It is the little things like how the cards move onto the board and then turn into either a minion or manifest themselves in a brutal attack. </p>
            <p>
                Verdict: It’s always a good sign when a game’s only major downside is that there just isn’t enough of it. The elegant simplicity of Hearthstone’s rules, its impressive attention to detail and personality, and the true viability of playing completely for free make it easy to fall under its spell and get blissfully lost in the depths of its strategic possibilities.
